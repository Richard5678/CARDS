Let me recommend some places to explore and things to do on Kodiak Island! I recommend taking a scenic hike up Mount Olympus mountain to the state highpoint at 3000 feet above sea level to watch the sun set while enjoying the spectacular views over the town of Kodiak and the surrounding shores and waterways. You can hike to the Bear Lake Trail to look for Kodiak brown bears and other local wildlife, or visit Kachemak Bay State Park to see seals, sea otters, and shorebirds. The rugged Alaskan lifestyle and environment provide an excellent setting for fishing, kayaking, ocean kayaking, scuba diving, sailing, and shellfishing. People also enjoy camping and wildlife viewing, and visiting historic and cultural sites such as the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, Maritime Heritage Park, and Historic Porter House museums. The Kodiak Island is one of the best-preserved and most distinctively wild and remote locations in the United States, and offers an unforgettable island experience that you will never forge.\n\n\
